# 🍽️ Foodie Tour Workflow using Julep AI

## 🌟 Overview

This AI workflow builds a one-day "foodie itinerary" for a list of cities based on:
- Current or seasonal weather
- Indoor/outdoor dining recommendation
- 3 iconic local dishes
- Top-rated restaurants
- Creative breakfast, lunch, and dinner narratives

Built using [Julep AI](https://julep.ai), this workflow demonstrates how LLMs can enrich travel planning with local culinary intelligence.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Defines a Julep Agent (`claude-3.5-sonnet`) to act as a culinary travel planner.
- YAML-based task prompts the agent to:
  - Simulate today's weather
  - Recommend indoor/outdoor dining
  - Select 3 iconic local dishes
  - Choose restaurants
  - Write a full-day narrative itinerary

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Julep SDK
- `yaml` module for task loading

## 🌍 Cities Tested

- Paris 🇫🇷
- Tokyo 🇯🇵
- New York 🇺🇸

## ✅ Sample Output

Here's a snippet for **Paris**:

> _“You're sitting at this charming 19th-century bakery, where the scent of butter and almonds fills the air...”_

## 💡 Original Twist

I structured the tour to feel like a **mini travel blog**, complete with weather commentary, cultural notes, and local etiquette tips.
